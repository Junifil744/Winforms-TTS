# Winforms-TTS
A really quickly made TTS in WinForms meant for simplicity and useability.

## How to use:
1. Install some language packs. I don't think the program even runs if theres no TTS language pack installed.
2. Run the program
   - Do note the program starts minimized, it runs with what works for me so it wasn't an issue for me. Later I'll add config support
3. Set your virtual cable (VB-Cable, VAC, OBS Virtual Mic, etc)
4. Set your headphones to hear the playback of what you send
5. Press **CTRL+T**
6. Type
7. Press **ENTER** to say the line or **ESC** if you change your mind.

Features:
- A keybind.
- Quick to use, not in your way.
- Compact and small.
- Portable

Does not feature:
- TTS Built in, uses Windows Language Packs as options
- Linux support
- Other TTS models (curses, dectalk, etc)
- Handholding
- Any config file to change the defaults (yet, probs to add later)
