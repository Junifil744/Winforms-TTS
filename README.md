A *really* quickly made TTS in WinForms meant for simplicity and useability.

## How to use:
1. Install some language packs. I don't think the program even runs if theres no TTS language pack installed.
2. Run the program
   - Do note the program starts minimized, it runs with what works for me so it wasn't an issue for me. Later I'll add config support
3. Set your virtual cable (VB-Cable, VAC, OBS Virtual Mic, etc)
4. Set your headphones to hear the playback of what you send
5. Press **CTRL+T**
6. Type
7. Press **ENTER** to say the line or **ESC** if you change your mind.

Features:
- A __single__ keybind. `CTRL-T`
- Quick to use, *not in your way*.
- Compact and small.
- Portable.

Does __not__ feature:
- TTS Built in, uses Windows Language Packs as options.
- Linux support.
- Other TTS models (Piper, Dectalk, **any** cloud tts service, etc).
- Handholding.
- Any config file to change the defaults (yet, probs to add later).
